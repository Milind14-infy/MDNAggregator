# MDNAggregator
### Important
Make sure a `CSV_Files` folder is in the same directory as the exe or it will not work!
### Instructions
- Remove the placeholder.txt file from the `CSV_Files` folder. I was just there so the proper folder would also be downloaded.
- Place the CSV files you want to aggregate in the `CSV_Files` folder.
- The .csv files must have the MDNs in the first column with the first row being meta data.
- Run the exe and output.csv and activationLink.txt will be created for you.
